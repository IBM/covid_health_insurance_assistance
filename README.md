# Insurance Policy Assistant

This Code Pattern will demonstrate a methodology to build an assistant which can answer queries regarding the Covid Insurance Policies of various companies. And it will also compare the policies and top-up related queries given by them. In Watson Assistant, we will create Dialog skill and using the search skill capability  develop a model in Watson Discovery that will understand the policies and provide an interactive interface to the user. This application will come in handy for various insurance brokers and also a layman who wants to know and compare the policies of various companies.

When user has completed the pattern he will-

* Know how to connect a UI to Watson Assistant and create Dialog Skill. 
* Send sample documents to Watson Discovery answer train custom model. 
* Take personal details from the user using `Context variables` and use them in the Search Query to get personalised results. 
* User will learn how to integrate insights generated with Discovery back to Assistant.
